# 🎯 Project Overview
## 🛡️ Program Aim:
The aim of this GUI application is to continue educating users on cybersecurity in a friendly and interactive way. This chatbot has been designed to feel like a helpful assistant you can chat with, while learning how to stay safe online. It provides useful tips and advice on important topics like password safety, phishing scams, privacy settings, and more. It also lets users add cybersecurity-related tasks, set reminders, and test their knowledge using a quiz game – all in one program.

## 🖥️ How It Works:
When the application starts, a clean Windows Forms interface appears where the user can chat with the bot through GUI. You simply type in messages like "Add a task to update my password" or "Tell me about phishing" and the bot will respond in a friendly, natural way.  

The chatbot keeps track of what you say and can remember tasks, quiz answers, and reminders. It also uses some simple natural language techniques to understand your input and give the best response possible.

Users can interact using common language like:  
- “Remind me to enable 2FA”  
- “Start quiz”  
- “Show activity log”  
- “What have you done for me?”
